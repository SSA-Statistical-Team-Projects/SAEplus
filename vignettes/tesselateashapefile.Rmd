Poverty Mapping is central to the work of the World Bank. The purpose of this package is to create tools that use R functionalities to make this process accessible to beginning users. The poverty mapping process can be summarized as follows: 

- A few prerequisites are needed to begin coding towards a poverty map. A shapefile containing the geometry boundaries for the target areas in which poverty rates will be estimated. A household survey with geocoordinates either at the EA level or at the household level.
```{r setup}
library(SAEplus)

```
