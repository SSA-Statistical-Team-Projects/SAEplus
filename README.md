# SAEplus

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SAEplus package is to produce a set of R functions and tools
to pull remote sensing data as well as other geospatial data from
platforms such as Google Earth Engine, Open Street Maps, Facebook and
WorldPop. This package will also provide functions for pre-processing
these datasets towards small area estimation (SAE). Finally, some of the
SAE functions within the EMDI package will be updated to speed up the
SAE process using the data.table package. 

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of SAEplus from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("SAEplus") -->
<!-- ``` -->

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SSA-Statistical-Team-Projects/SAEplus")
```

<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(SAEplus) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
