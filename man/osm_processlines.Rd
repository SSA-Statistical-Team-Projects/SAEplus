\usage{
osm_processlines(
  shapefile_path = "data/cmr_polypop_boundary.shp",

}
\arguments{
\item{shapefile_path}{filepath of country/region shapefile with polygons of interest}

\item{osm_path}{filepath to open street map lines data (road networks)}

\item{geoid_var}{the variable that points to the common identifier ID between shapefile_path object and osm_path object}

\item{feature_var}{specific feature of interest in the osm_path object}
}
\value{
A list containing two objects: a dataframe/datatable with original OSM lines data containing feature length
in polygon shapefile (from shapefile_path argument) and a lazy datatable version of the full OSM line data
with point information
