\title{Another function to create a gridified shapefile and extract a raster if specified}
\usage{
gengrid2(
  shp_dt = NULL,
  shp_dsn,
  shp_layer,
  grid_size,
  sqr = TRUE,
  pop_raster,
  raster_path,
  extract_name,
  raster_function = "sum"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shp_dt}{an object of class 'sf' or 'sfc'}

\item{shp_dsn}{character; the local directory folder in which the shapefile is location. Must be specified
when shp_dt is not specified.}

\item{shp_layer}{character; the layer name for the shapefile. Must be specified with shp_dsn when shp_dt is not
specified}

\item{grid_size}{numeric of length 1; representing the desired size of the grid in meters}

\item{sqr}{logical; if TRUE, a square grid is created. If FALSE, a hexagonal polygon grid is created}

\item{pop_raster}{raster; an object of class 'raster'}

\item{raster_path}{character; if pop_raster is not specified but raster is to read in from file. raster_path is
the full name of the raster (including filepath)}

\item{extract_name}{character of length 1; the name of the indicator to be extracted from the raster}

\item{raster_function}{function to be applied in extracting raster into created grids}
}
\description{
This function takes in only a shapefile and creates a square or hexagon polygon grid based on a specified
grid size
}
